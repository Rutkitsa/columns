                    <p>Say you’ve got a <strong> &lt;Card/&gt;</strong>component. 
                        It’s highly likely it shouldn’t be butted 
                        right up against any other components with no
                         spacing around it. That’s true for… pretty 
                         much every component. So, how do you handle 
                         component spacing in a design system?</p>

                        color features</p>
                    <p>I was just writing in my “What’s new in since 
                        CSS3?” article about recent and possible future
                         changes to CSS colors. It’s weirdly a lot. 
                         There are just as many or more new and upcoming
                          ways to define colors than what we have now. 
                          I thought we’d take a really quick look.<br>
                          First, a major heads up. This stuff is so 
                          complicated. I barely understand it. But here 
                          are some aspects:
                        <ul> 
                            <li>Before all this upcoming change, we only had RGB 
                                as a color model, and everything dealt with that.</li>                      
                            <li>We had different “color spaces” that handled it 
                                differently (e.g. the rgb() function mapped that
                                 RGB color model as a cube with linear coordinates, 
                                the hsl() function mapped that RGB color model as a 
                                cylinder) but it was all sRGB gamut.</li>
                            <li>With the upcoming changes, we’re getting new color 
                                models and (!) we’re getting new functions that map 
                                that color model differently. So I think it’s kind of
                                a double-triple whammy.</li>

                    <p>A custom favicon is a great way to polish a 
                            web project. It displays on desktop browser
                             tabs, and also inside "save for later" readers,
                              other blog posts linking to your site, and more.
                               Traditionally this has been done with the .ico 
                               file type, but recently browsers have allowed 
                               use of SVG, a vector format.</p>
